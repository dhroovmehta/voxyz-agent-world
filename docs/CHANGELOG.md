# Frasier — Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

---

## [0.5.0] — 2026-02-22 (Contentron Integration)

### Added
- **`!content` command family:** 6 subcommands for managing the Contentron content pipeline from Discord — `list`, `view`, `approve`, `reject`, `revise`, `stats`
- **`!watchlist` command family:** 3 subcommands for managing Scout's monitoring targets — `list`, `add`, `remove`
- **`src/lib/content.js`:** New module with all content pipeline and watchlist Supabase queries, decoupled from Discord I/O
- **Short UUID support:** Draft IDs can be referenced by first 8 characters for convenience
- **Idempotent mutations:** Approving an already-published draft or rejecting an already-discarded draft returns a friendly no-op message
- **25 new tests:** `tests/contentron/content.test.js` — full coverage of content pipeline + watchlist CRUD (total: 169 tests passing)
- **Updated `!help`:** Now includes Content Pipeline and Watchlist command sections

### Notes
- Frasier writes to shared Supabase tables; Contentron reads on its 2-hour tick. Zero direct communication.
- All status changes are logged as events (`content_approved`, `content_rejected`, `content_revision_requested`, `watchlist_item_added`, `watchlist_item_removed`)

## [0.4.1] — 2026-02-17 (Autonomous Lifecycle + Announcement Fix)

### Added
- **Auto-phase-progression:** When a project completes a phase, heartbeat automatically creates a mission proposal for the next phase with prior phase output as context. No manual intervention needed. (`PHASE_TASKS` constant defines work for each phase.)
- **Stalled project detection:** `checkStalledProjects()` runs every heartbeat tick — detects active projects stuck in a phase with no active missions or pending proposals, and auto-creates the missing phase mission.

### Fixed
- **OpenRouter model IDs:** Changed `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929` → `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5` and `anthropic/claude-opus-4-20250514` → `anthropic/claude-opus-4`. Old date-suffixed IDs returned API 400 errors, causing all T2/T3 tasks to fall back to T1 MiniMax.
- **Announcement duplicate spam:** `announced = true` was set AFTER Notion/Drive publishing. When Supabase returned Cloudflare 500 errors after publish succeeded, the flag never persisted — steps were re-published every 30-second poll cycle (infinite duplicate Notion pages + Google Docs). Fix: mark `announced = true` BEFORE publishing.
- **Announcement loop crash:** No try/catch around individual step processing in `announceCompletedSteps()`. One Notion/Drive error aborted announcements for all remaining steps. Fix: inner try/catch around Notion/Drive (still announces to Discord without links) + outer try/catch per step (skips failed step, continues loop).

## [0.4.0] — 2026-02-17 (Quality Overhaul)

### Added
- **Tier 3 keyword routing:** New `TIER3_KEYWORDS` constant routes high-stakes deliverables (product requirements, design documents, executive reports, business cases, investment memos) to Claude Opus automatically
- **T3→T2→T1 fallback chain:** If Opus fails, degrades to Sonnet, then MiniMax — never fails silently
- **"YOU ARE the expert" prompt framing:** All 7 domain instructions + generic fallback + universal quality standards now enforce agents as DOERs, not ADVISORs
- **Dynamic role determination:** `determineDynamicProjectRoles()` uses T1 LLM call to identify industry-specific specialist roles (e.g., "Real Estate Market Analyst", "Healthcare Compliance Specialist") instead of hardcoded 7-category keyword matching
- **Industry-specific persona generation:** Gap-fill agents now get personas immediately upon hiring, with project context injected for domain expertise. Quality standards baked into every persona.
- **Domain expert reviews:** `processApprovals()` searches ALL active agents for a domain expert before falling back to QA/Team Lead. Expert cannot review own work.
- **5 new test suites:** `tier-restructure` (22), `prompt-quality` (21), `dynamic-roles` (8), `industry-hiring` (2), `expert-reviews` (7) — total 144 tests passing

### Changed
- **Tier 2 model:** Manus (never configured) → Claude Sonnet 4.5 via OpenRouter (`anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5`)
- **Tier 2 API key:** `MANUS_API_KEY` → `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (same key as T1/T3)
- **`selectTier()` routing:** Now 3-tier (T3 keywords → T2 keywords → T1 default). Previously only T1/T2 with Manus availability check that always returned false.
- **`autoHireGapAgent()` signature:** Now accepts optional `options` parameter with `{ projectDescription, projectName }`
- **`generatePersona()` signature:** Now accepts optional `projectContext` parameter
- **`!costs` display:** "Manus" → "Sonnet", "Claude" → "Opus", T2 now shows cost
- **Cost alert display:** Same naming updates as `!costs`
- **`discord_bot.js` NEW_PROJECT handler:** Uses `determineDynamicProjectRoles()` (async, LLM-based) instead of `determineProjectRoles()` (sync, keyword-based)

### Removed
- **Manus-specific code:** `MANUS_CREDITS_EXHAUSTED` error handling in models.js and worker.js
- **Manus endpoint check:** `makeAPICall()` no longer checks for Manus endpoint configuration
- **Manus availability guard:** `selectTier()` no longer checks `MODELS.tier2.endpoint && process.env[MODELS.tier2.apiKeyEnv]`
- **T3 approval gate:** Tier 3 no longer requires founder approval — auto-routes by keyword

## [0.3.1] — 2026-02-17 (Post-Overhaul Fixes)

### Fixed
- **Clean proposal titles:** `cleanProposalTitle()` strips Discord mentions, URLs, `[PROJECT:N]` tags; extracts first sentence; caps at 120 chars
- **T2→T1 fallback:** When Manus (T2) failed for non-credit reasons, steps were permanently stuck. Now auto-retries with T1.
- **Announcement error logging:** `announceCompletedSteps()` no longer silently swallows Supabase query errors

---

## [0.3.0] — 2026-02-17 (System Overhaul)

### Added
- **Test infrastructure:** Jest + in-memory Supabase mock + factory helpers. 84 tests across 7 suites.
- **Roster injection:** Frasier now sees all teams + agents in system prompt. Uses "Name (Role)" format.
- **Context enrichment pipeline:** `buildTaskContext()` combines original message + domain mandates + output template + quality standards
- **Auto tier selection:** `selectTier()` with keyword-based T2 upgrades + final step detection
- **Persona-as-rubric:** `QUALITY_RUBRICS` baked into agent personas (100% retrieval)
- **Enhanced reviews:** 5-criterion rubric scoring, auto-reject on score < 3, structured feedback
- **Project lifecycle:** Discovery → Requirements → Design → Build → Test → Deploy → Completed
- **Smart routing:** Cross-team agent matching via `findBestAgentAcrossTeams()`
- **Gap-fill hiring:** `autoHireGapAgent()` for instant agent creation when no match found
