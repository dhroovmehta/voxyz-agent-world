# Frasier — Decision Log

All architectural and design decisions, with context and trade-offs.

---

## D-001: Minimalist Architecture (PostgreSQL + Node.js Workers)

**Date:** Feb 11, 2026 | **Status:** Active | **Author:** Zero + Kai

**Context:** Three architecture options: OpenAI Assistants API (managed), LangChain/AutoGPT (framework), or custom PostgreSQL + Node.js (minimalist).

**Decision:** Custom minimalist architecture. No frameworks. PostgreSQL is the orchestration layer.

**Rationale:** Full control, no vendor lock-in, $8/month infra, matches founder's vision.

**Trade-offs:** More initial development, no pre-built agent collaboration.

---

## D-002: Discord as Primary Interface

**Date:** Feb 11, 2026 | **Status:** Active | **Author:** Zero + Kai

**Context:** Need a communication layer for founder-agent and agent-agent interaction.

**Decision:** Discord for v1.0. Pixel-art frontend deferred.

**Rationale:** Familiar, real-time, free, rich formatting, mobile app.

---

## D-003: Supabase Free Tier

**Date:** Feb 11, 2026 | **Status:** Active | **Author:** Zero + Kai

**Context:** Need managed PostgreSQL.

**Decision:** Supabase free tier (500MB storage, 2GB bandwidth).

**Rationale:** $0 cost, sufficient for current scale, easy upgrade path.

**Risk:** Storage/bandwidth limits. Monitor via `!costs`.

---

## D-004: PM2 Process Management

**Date:** Feb 11, 2026 | **Status:** Active | **Author:** Kai

**Context:** Need to run 3 Node.js processes continuously on VPS.

**Decision:** PM2 with auto-restart, log management, `pm2 save` for persistence.

---

## D-005: Persona Modification Over Lessons for Upskilling

**Date:** Feb 15, 2026 | **Status:** Active | **Author:** Zero

**Context:** Two approaches to make agents smarter: modify their persona (always in system prompt) or add lessons (top 5 retrieved per call).

**Decision:** Persona is the primary vehicle. 100% retrieval rate. Lessons are supplementary.

**Rationale:** Persona is always present in every LLM call. Lessons compete for limited slots.

---

## D-006: Frasier as Chief of Staff (Not Jet)

**Date:** Feb 15, 2026 | **Status:** Active | **Author:** Zero

**Context:** Original spec named the CoS agent "Jet" (Cowboy Bebop). Founder preferred "Frasier" — the system's namesake.

**Decision:** Renamed to Frasier. Has $20k/month north star revenue goal in SEP.

---

## D-007: No Firing — Only Upskilling

**Date:** Feb 15, 2026 | **Status:** Active | **Author:** Zero

**Context:** When agents perform poorly, should they be fired or upskilled?

**Decision:** No firing for now. After 5 QA rejections, agents get persona-based upskilling.

---

## D-008: Full Conversation Recall

**Date:** Feb 15, 2026 | **Status:** Active | **Author:** Zero

**Context:** How to store agent conversations — summarize or keep full turns?

**Decision:** Each conversation turn saved as its own memory row with real topic tags. Full recall.

---

## D-009: Founder Directives as Permanent Lessons

**Date:** Feb 15, 2026 | **Status:** Active | **Author:** Zero

**Context:** When founder gives a directive, how should it be stored?

**Decision:** Saved as permanent lessons with importance 9 (near-max). Always retrieved.

---

## D-010: Tiered LLM Routing (MiniMax → Sonnet 4.5 → Opus)

**Date:** Feb 17, 2026 | **Status:** Active | **Author:** Kael

**Context:** Manus (T2) was never configured. Everything ran on MiniMax (cheapest, lowest quality). Research/strategy tasks produced shallow, generic results.

**Decision:** 3-tier routing via keyword matching:
- **T1 (Default):** MiniMax — simple tasks
- **T2 (Complex):** Claude Sonnet 4.5 — research, strategy, analysis, final steps
- **T3 (High-Stakes):** Claude Opus — PRDs, design docs, executive reports

Fallback chain: T3→T2→T1 if higher tier fails.

**Rationale:** 80% of tasks still use cheap T1. Only complex/high-stakes work uses expensive models. Cost-optimized.

**Files changed:** `models.js`, `worker.js`, `discord_bot.js`, `heartbeat.js`

---

## D-011: Remove Manus, Replace with Sonnet 4.5

**Date:** Feb 17, 2026 | **Status:** Active | **Author:** Kael

**Context:** Manus was listed as T2 but never had endpoint/key configured. `MANUS_CREDITS_EXHAUSTED` error handling existed but Manus was never called.

**Decision:** Replace Manus entirely with Claude Sonnet 4.5 via OpenRouter. Same API key as T1/T3. Remove all Manus-specific code.

**Rationale:** One API provider (OpenRouter), one API key, no dead code.

---

## D-012: Remove T3 Founder Approval Gate

**Date:** Feb 17, 2026 | **Status:** Active | **Author:** Zero + Kael

**Context:** T3 (Opus) required founder approval before use. Bottleneck — founder had to be online.

**Decision:** T3 auto-routes by keyword. No approval needed.

**Rationale:** Founder wants autonomous operation. T3 keywords are well-defined. Cost is predictable.

---

## D-013: Dynamic LLM-Based Role Determination

**Date:** Feb 17, 2026 | **Status:** Active | **Author:** Kael

**Context:** `determineProjectRoles()` used hardcoded 7-category keyword matching. Every new project type needed code changes. Founder explicitly rejected hardcoded BA/PO/PM roles.

**Decision:** `determineDynamicProjectRoles()` uses a T1 LLM call to return 2-5 industry-specific role titles (e.g., "Real Estate Market Analyst", "Healthcare Compliance Specialist") with a `category` field for team routing. Falls back to keyword matching if LLM fails.

**Rationale:** Any project, any industry — zero code changes. The category field maps to existing team routing infrastructure.

**Trade-offs:** Extra T1 LLM call (~$0.01) per project creation.

---

## D-014: Industry-Specific Persona Generation

**Date:** Feb 17, 2026 | **Status:** Active | **Author:** Kael

**Context:** Gap-fill agents (auto-hired when no existing agent matches a needed role) got bare database records with no persona, no domain expertise.

**Decision:** Generate persona immediately after auto-hiring. Inject project context (name, description) into the persona generation prompt. Bake quality standards into every persona.

**Rationale:** Agents need domain knowledge to produce quality work. Persona is always in system prompt (100% retrieval). Quality standards are non-negotiable.

**Files changed:** `agents.js` (autoHireGapAgent accepts options), `heartbeat.js` (generatePersona accepts projectContext, processProposals generates persona for gap-fills)

---

## D-015: Domain Expert Reviews

**Date:** Feb 17, 2026 | **Status:** Active | **Author:** Kael

**Context:** QA and Team Lead agents reviewed all work regardless of domain. A QA Engineer can't evaluate real estate market analysis quality.

**Decision:** `processApprovals()` searches ALL active agents for a domain expert (matching role keywords) before falling back to QA→Team Lead. Expert cannot review own work.

**Rationale:** A "Real Estate Market Analyst" reviewing market research catches domain errors a generalist QA agent would miss.

---

## D-016: "YOU ARE the Expert" Prompt Framing

**Date:** Feb 17, 2026 | **Status:** Active | **Author:** Kael

**Context:** Agents produced meta-instructions ("here's what a BA should do") instead of actual deliverables ("here is the market analysis").

**Decision:** All 7 domain instructions + generic fallback + universal quality standards now enforce agents as DOERs. Every prompt prefixed with "YOU ARE the expert [Role]. You are doing the work yourself." Every prompt suffixed with anti-meta directive.

**Rationale:** Without explicit framing, LLMs default to "helpful assistant" mode = meta-advice. Explicit DOER framing produces actual deliverables.

---

## D-017: Deploy Script Required (Not Just git pull)

**Date:** Feb 16, 2026 | **Status:** Active | **Author:** Zero (learned the hard way)

**Context:** Deployed with `git pull && pm2 restart all` but forgot `npm install`. Missing `nodemailer` dependency took down discord_bot + heartbeat for hours.

**Decision:** Always use `./deploy.sh` which includes `npm install`. Never skip dependency installation.
