**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** February 17, 2026
**Author:** Zero (Founder) with Kai (Technical Lead)
**Status:** Live — Quality Overhaul (v0.4.0) shipped Feb 17, 2026

---

## Executive Summary

Frasier is a fully autonomous AI organization system consisting of 7 specialized AI agents that operate 24/7 with minimal founder oversight. The system enables a non-technical founder (Zero) to run a complete business operation through intelligent agents that research opportunities, create content, build digital products, and manage day-to-day operations.

**Core Value Proposition:**
- **Autonomous Operation:** Agents work independently, make decisions, and execute tasks without constant supervision
- **Specialized Expertise:** Each agent has 15-20 years of simulated experience in their domain
- **Always-On Availability:** 24/7 operation with agents collaborating across time zones
- **Cost-Effective:** $8/month fixed infrastructure + LLM usage (estimated $25-110/month total)
- **Self-Managing:** Agents learn from experience, adapt their approaches, and improve over time

**Target Launch:** February 14, 2026 EOD (4-day sprint from Feb 11-14)

## Problem Statement

### The Challenge

Non-technical founders face a critical bottleneck: they have vision and business acumen but lack the technical team, operational bandwidth, and 24/7 availability needed to execute at scale. Traditional solutions include:

- **Hiring a team:** Expensive ($300K+ annually for 6 specialists), slow to build, requires management overhead
- **Freelancers:** Inconsistent quality, coordination overhead, not always available
- **DIY:** Founder burnout, slow execution, limited by personal expertise
- **No-code tools:** Limited capabilities, still requires significant founder time

### The Opportunity

Recent advances in LLM capabilities (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4) enable AI agents to perform complex knowledge work with human-level quality. By combining:

- **Specialized AI agents** with distinct personalities and expertise
- **Autonomous decision-making** with appropriate guardrails
- **Persistent memory and learning** from past experiences
- **Structured workflows** that mirror real team operations

...we can create a virtual organization that operates like a seasoned team of experts, available 24/7, at a fraction of the cost.

### Success Vision

Zero can focus on high-level strategy and decision-making while the agent team:
- Researches market opportunities and competitive intelligence
- Creates content for marketing and audience building
- Builds and ships digital products
- Manages operations and knowledge
- Grows the business through marketing and distribution

The system should feel like having a trusted executive team that "just handles it."

## Initial Prompt & Discovery

### Founder's Original Vision

**From Zero's initial prompt (Feb 11, 2026):**

> "I want to build 6 AI agents that run a company from scratch. Here's what I'm looking for:
> 
> - Agents doing real work every day: scanning intelligence, writing content, posting tweets, running analyses
> - 10-15 conversations per day: standups, debates, watercooler chats, one-on-one mentoring
> - Agents that remember lessons learned and factor them into future decisions
> - Relationships that shift — collaborate more, affinity goes up; argue too much, it drops
> - Speaking styles that evolve — an agent with lots of 'tweet engagement' experience starts naturally referencing engagement strategies
> - Full transparency — a pixel-art office on the frontend showing everything in real time
> 
> Tech stack: Next.js + Supabase + VPS. Monthly cost: $8 fixed + LLM usage.
> No OpenAI Assistants API. No LangChain. No AutoGPT. Just PostgreSQL + a few Node.js workers + a rule engine."

### Discovery Questions & Answers

**Q1: Cost Experiments - What's your comfort level?**

Three options presented:
- **Option A:** $25/month (minimal LLM usage, basic features)
- **Option B:** $50-75/month (moderate usage, full features)
- **Option C:** $100-110/month (heavy usage, advanced features)

**Answer:** "Option B or C. I have 8+ hours/day to dedicate. Budget is flexible if it delivers value."

---

**Q2: Timeline Expectations**

**Answer:** "I want to move fast. 4-day sprint to get v1.0 live by Feb 14 EOD. I'm starting from zero (no existing business)."

---

**Q3: Approval Thresholds**

Three governance models:
- **Option A:** Manual approval for everything (founder bottleneck)
- **Option B:** Hybrid (free actions automatic, spending requires approval)
- **Option C:** Self-maintaining (agents decide within constraints)

**Answer:** "Option C preferred, Option B as backup. I want the system to be autonomous. Free actions should be automatic. Spending over $100 requires approval."

---

**Q4: Data Privacy Approach**

**Answer:** "Balanced approach. Use trusted platforms (Supabase, DigitalOcean). Encrypt sensitive data. I'm okay with Google Workspace, Notion, Discord for team operations."

---

**Q5: Business Goals**

**Answer:** 
- "Starting from zero (no existing business)
- Want agents to research profitable online business opportunities
- Parameters: Faceless businesses, $1K-2K startup budget, high risk tolerance
- Also acquiring a small business - will need M&A advisory and deal structuring later
- Want daily standup summaries published to Notion"

---

**Q6: Communication Preferences**

**Answer:** "Direct, concise. No filler. Ask questions one by one. I expect the team to suggest business ideas that are viable and sustainable."

---

**Q7: Agent Expectations**

**Answer:** "All agents are 'masters of their craft' with 15-20 years experience. Chief Agent should be a seasoned executive combining strategy, operations, and leadership. Each agent has successful track record and best practices encoded."

### Component Descriptions

#### 1. Discord Bot (`discord_bot.js`)
**Purpose:** Interface between Discord and the system

**Responsibilities:**
- Listen for messages in #executive channel
- Create mission proposals in database when founder posts
- Poll database for completed tasks
- Post task results to #updates channel
- Handle message length limits (split long messages)

**Key Logic:**
- Ignore bot messages (prevent loops)
- Capture full message content (not placeholders)
- Mark tasks as "announced" to prevent duplicate posts
- Poll every 10 seconds for new completions

#### 2. Heartbeat (`heartbeat_local.js`)
**Purpose:** Mission orchestration and task assignment

**Responsibilities:**
- Poll for pending proposals every 30 seconds
- Auto-accept proposals (or route to Chief Agent for approval)
- Create missions from accepted proposals
- Assign tasks to appropriate agents
- Track mission status

**Key Logic:**
- Simple routing: hardcode to "edward" for v1.0
- Create one task per mission initially
- Handle errors gracefully (log and continue)
- No description column in ops_missions (schema cache issue workaround)

#### 3. Worker (`intelligent_worker.js`)
**Purpose:** Task execution using LLM intelligence

**Responsibilities:**
- Poll for pending tasks continuously
- Fetch agent personality and expertise from database
- Construct LLM prompt with agent context + task description
- Call Claude 3.5 Sonnet via OpenRouter
- Save result to database
- Mark task as completed

**Key Logic:**
- Agent prompt includes: role, personality, expertise, task
- LLM temperature: 0.7 (balanced creativity/consistency)
- Error handling: retry once, then mark failed
- Result stored in `ops_mission_steps.result` field

### Data Flow

**Mission Lifecycle:**

```
1. Founder posts in Discord
   ↓
2. Discord bot creates proposal (status: pending)
   ↓
3. Heartbeat picks up proposal
   ↓
4. Heartbeat accepts proposal (status: accepted)
   ↓
5. Heartbeat creates mission (status: in_progress)
   ↓
6. Heartbeat creates task (status: pending, assigned to agent)
   ↓
7. Worker picks up task
   ↓
8. Worker calls LLM with agent context
   ↓
9. Worker saves result (status: completed)
   ↓
10. Discord bot picks up completion
   ↓
11. Discord bot posts to #updates
   ↓
12. Discord bot marks as announced
```

### Process Management

**PM2 Configuration:**

```javascript
// 3 processes running continuously
[
  { id: 5, name: "discord_bot", script: "discord_bot.js" },
  { id: 9, name: "heartbeat", script: "heartbeat_local.js" },
  { id: 2, name: "worker", script: "intelligent_worker.js" }
]
```

**Auto-restart:** Enabled for all processes  
**Logs:** Stored in `/root/.pm2/logs/`  
**Persistence:** `pm2 save` creates dump file for auto-start on reboot

### Workflow 2: Error Handling

**Scenario: LLM API Failure**

```
Worker encounters error during LLM call
  ↓
Log error to console
  ↓
Retry once after 5 second delay
  ↓
If still fails:
  - UPDATE status = 'failed'
  - Save error message in result field
  - Continue to next task
```

**Scenario: Database Connection Lost**

```
Process encounters database error
  ↓
Log error to PM2 logs
  ↓
Process exits with error code
  ↓
PM2 auto-restarts process
  ↓
Process reconnects to database
  ↓
Resume normal operation
```

**Scenario: Discord Bot Spam Prevention**

```
Task completed multiple times (worker bug)
  ↓
Discord bot checks announced = false
  ↓
Only posts first completion
  ↓
Sets announced = true
  ↓
Subsequent checks skip already-announced tasks
```

## Decisions Made

### Strategic Decisions

#### Decision 1: Minimalist Architecture (Option C)

**Context:** Three architecture options presented:
- Option A: Use OpenAI Assistants API (managed, expensive)
- Option B: Use LangChain/AutoGPT (framework-heavy)
- Option C: Custom PostgreSQL + Node.js workers (minimalist)

**Decision:** Option C - Custom minimalist architecture

**Rationale:**
- Full control over logic and data
- No vendor lock-in
- Lower cost ($8/month vs $50+/month)
- Aligns with founder's technical vision
- Easier to debug and customize

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **Option A rejected:** Too expensive, less control, vendor lock-in
- **Option B rejected:** Framework complexity, harder to customize, potential bugs in dependencies

**Trade-offs Accepted:**
- More initial development work
- Need to build features from scratch
- No pre-built agent collaboration frameworks

---

#### Decision 2: Discord as Primary Interface

**Context:** Need communication layer for founder-agent and agent-agent interaction

**Decision:** Use Discord as the primary interface (no custom frontend for v1.0)

**Rationale:**
- Familiar interface (founder already uses Discord)
- Real-time updates
- Free
- Rich formatting support
- Mobile app available
- Faster to implement than custom UI

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **Slack:** Similar but not free for full features
- **Custom web UI:** Too much development time for v1.0
- **Email:** Not real-time, poor UX for conversations

**Trade-offs Accepted:**
- Less polished than custom UI
- Limited to Discord's UX patterns
- Pixel-art office visualization deferred to future phase

---

#### Decision 3: Hardcode Task Assignment to Edward (v1.0)

**Context:** Need to route tasks to appropriate agents, but smart routing is complex

**Decision:** Hardcode all tasks to Edward for v1.0, implement smart routing in v2.0

**Rationale:**
- Faster to launch (4-day sprint deadline)
- Proves core loop works
- Edward (research specialist) can handle diverse tasks initially
- Smart routing can be added incrementally

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **Keyword-based routing:** Implemented but not deployed due to time constraints
- **LLM-based routing:** Too expensive (extra LLM call per task)
- **Manual routing:** Requires founder to specify agent in every message

**Trade-offs Accepted:**
- Other agents (Faye, Spike, etc.) not utilized in v1.0
- Some tasks may not get optimal specialist
- Need to add routing logic later

---

### Technical Decisions

#### Decision 4: Supabase Free Tier (Not Paid)

**Context:** Need managed PostgreSQL database

**Decision:** Use Supabase free tier (500MB, 2GB bandwidth)

**Rationale:**
- Sufficient for v1.0 (estimated 1000 missions/month = ~50MB)
- $0 cost
- Easy to upgrade if needed
- Real-time subscriptions available (future feature)

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **Supabase Pro ($25/month):** Unnecessary for v1.0 scale
- **Self-hosted PostgreSQL:** More complex, no cost savings
- **Railway/Render:** Similar pricing, less mature

**Trade-offs Accepted:**
- 500MB storage limit (need to monitor)
- 2GB bandwidth limit (should be sufficient)
- Free tier support is slower

---

#### Decision 5: Claude 3.5 Sonnet via OpenRouter

**Context:** Need LLM for agent intelligence

**Decision:** Use Claude 3.5 Sonnet via OpenRouter

**Rationale:**
- High-quality reasoning and writing
- Good at following personality/role instructions
- OpenRouter provides flexibility (can switch models)
- Competitive pricing (~$0.50-1.00 per complex task)

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **GPT-4:** More expensive, similar quality
- **GPT-4 Mini:** Cheaper but lower quality
- **Open-source models (Llama, Mixtral):** Require self-hosting, lower quality

**Trade-offs Accepted:**
- Cost per task higher than GPT-4 Mini
- Dependent on OpenRouter uptime
- Anthropic API rate limits apply

---

#### Decision 6: PM2 for Process Management

**Context:** Need to run 3 Node.js processes continuously

**Decision:** Use PM2 process manager

**Rationale:**
- Industry standard for Node.js
- Auto-restart on failure
- Log management
- Simple CLI
- Free and open-source

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **systemd:** More complex, Linux-specific
- **Docker:** Overkill for 3 simple processes
- **Manual (screen/tmux):** No auto-restart, poor log management

**Trade-offs Accepted:**
- Adds dependency (npm install pm2)
- Learning curve for founder

---

#### Decision 7: Remove `description` Column from `ops_missions`

**Context:** Supabase PostgREST schema cache bug (PGRST204 error) prevents using newly added columns

**Decision:** Remove `description` field from mission INSERT, store description only in `ops_mission_steps`

**Rationale:**
- Workaround for known Supabase bug (GitHub issue #42183)
- Unblocks development immediately
- Description still accessible via mission steps
- Cache refresh unpredictable (10-60 minutes)

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **Wait for cache refresh:** Unpredictable timing, blocks progress
- **Restart Supabase project:** May not work, causes downtime
- **Use RPC function:** Adds complexity, still may hit cache

**Trade-offs Accepted:**
- Mission table has less information
- Need to join with steps to get full context
- Slight data model inconsistency

---

### Quality Overhaul Decisions (v0.4.0 — Feb 17, 2026)

#### Decision 10: Tiered LLM Routing (MiniMax → Sonnet → Opus)

**Context:** Manus (T2) was never configured — all tasks ran on MiniMax (cheapest). Research/strategy tasks produced shallow results.

**Decision:** Replace Manus with Claude Sonnet 4.5 via OpenRouter. Add Opus as T3 for high-stakes deliverables. Auto-route by keyword matching.

**Rationale:**
- MiniMax is fine for simple tasks but lacks depth for research/strategy
- Sonnet 4.5 provides the quality boost needed for complex work
- Opus reserved for PRDs, design docs, executive reports
- All through OpenRouter — single API key, single billing

**Trade-offs:** Higher cost for T2/T3 tasks, but 80% of tasks still use cheap T1.

---

#### Decision 11: Dynamic LLM-Based Role Determination

**Context:** `determineProjectRoles()` used hardcoded 7-category keyword matching. Every new project type (real estate, healthcare, etc.) needed code changes.

**Decision:** Replace with `determineDynamicProjectRoles()` — an LLM call (T1, cheap) that returns free-form industry-specific role titles with category mapping.

**Rationale:**
- Any project, any industry — no code changes needed
- LLM returns titles like "Real Estate Market Analyst" instead of generic "Research Analyst"
- Category field maps to standing teams for routing (still uses existing keyword system)
- Falls back to keyword matching if LLM fails

**Trade-offs:** Extra T1 LLM call per project creation (~$0.01). Worth it for flexibility.

---

#### Decision 12: Persona Modification > Lessons for Upskilling

**Context:** Need agents to get smarter over time. Two approaches: lessons (top 5 retrieved per call) or persona modification (always in system prompt).

**Decision:** Persona is the primary vehicle for agent expertise. Quality standards baked into every persona. Lessons are supplementary.

**Rationale:**
- Persona is always in the system prompt = 100% retrieval rate
- Lessons compete for top 5 slots = variable retrieval
- Industry-specific domain knowledge belongs in persona, not lessons
- Quality standards ("YOU ARE the DOER") must be non-negotiable = persona

---

#### Decision 13: Domain Expert Reviews Over Generic QA

**Context:** QA and Team Lead agents rubber-stamped everything regardless of domain. A QA Engineer can't evaluate the quality of a real estate market analysis.

**Decision:** `processApprovals()` now searches ALL active agents for a domain expert before falling back to QA/Team Lead.

**Rationale:**
- A "Real Estate Market Analyst" reviewing a market research report will catch domain errors
- Cross-team search ensures the best reviewer is found regardless of team assignment
- Expert cannot review own work (prevents self-approval)
- Graceful fallback to QA→Team Lead when no expert exists

---

#### Decision 14: Remove Tier 3 Founder Approval Gate

**Context:** T3 (Opus) originally required founder approval before use. This created a bottleneck — founder had to be online for high-quality deliverables.

**Decision:** T3 auto-routes by keyword. No approval needed.

**Rationale:**
- Founder wants autonomous operation
- T3 keywords are well-defined (PRDs, design docs, executive reports)
- Cost is predictable — only specific task types trigger T3
- Founder can monitor via `!costs` command

---

### Operational Decisions

#### Decision 8: 4-Day Sprint Timeline

**Context:** Founder wants to launch quickly

**Decision:** Commit to Feb 14 EOD launch deadline (4-day sprint)

**Rationale:**
- Founder has 8+ hours/day availability
- MVP features are well-defined
- Faster iteration beats perfect planning
- Can add features post-launch

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **1-week sprint:** More buffer, but delays value delivery
- **2-week sprint:** Too slow for founder's pace

**Trade-offs Accepted:**
- Some features deferred (smart routing, frontend, agent collaboration)
- Higher risk of bugs in v1.0
- Less time for testing

---

#### Decision 9: One Question at a Time

**Context:** Founder is non-technical and prefers focused communication

**Decision:** Ask questions one by one, wait for answer before next question

**Rationale:**
- Reduces cognitive load
- Ensures clarity before proceeding
- Matches founder's communication preference
- Prevents misunderstandings

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **Batch questions:** Faster but overwhelming for non-technical founder
- **Assume answers:** Risky, may build wrong thing

**Trade-offs Accepted:**
- Slower discovery process
- More back-and-forth messages

---

## Lessons Learned

### Lesson 1: Supabase Schema Cache Bug (PGRST204)

#### Problem
After adding the `description` column to `ops_missions` table via `ALTER TABLE`, PostgREST API returned error:
```
PGRST204: "Could not find the 'description' column of 'ops_missions' in the schema cache"
```

#### Root Cause
**Known Supabase bug (GitHub issue #42183):** PostgREST schema cache does not automatically refresh when columns are added via SQL or Dashboard GUI. The cache persists stale schema information despite documented refresh methods (`NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema'`, project pause/resume).

#### Impact
- Blocked mission creation for 2+ hours
- Caused confusion (column exists in database but API can't see it)
- Led to multiple failed workaround attempts

#### Solution
**Workaround:** Remove `description` field from INSERT statement. Store description only in `ops_mission_steps` table (which was created before the cache issue).

**Code Change:**
```javascript
// BEFORE (broken)
const { data: mission } = await supabase
  .from("ops_missions")
  .insert([{
    proposal_id: proposal.id,
    title: proposal.title,
    description: proposal.description,  // ❌ Not in cache
    status: "in_progress"
  }]);

// AFTER (working)
const { data: mission } = await supabase
  .from("ops_missions")
  .insert([{
    proposal_id: proposal.id,
    title: proposal.title,
    // description removed
    status: "in_progress"
  }]);
```

#### Prevention Guidelines
1. **Create all database tables and columns BEFORE starting application development**
2. **If you must add columns later:**
   - Wait 10-60 minutes for cache to auto-refresh
   - OR restart Supabase project (may not work)
   - OR use direct SQL via RPC functions (bypasses PostgREST)
3. **Test schema changes immediately** with a simple INSERT before building features
4. **Document schema cache issues** in project notes for future reference

#### Technical Deep Dive
- **PostgREST** caches database schema for performance
- Cache refresh triggered by `NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema'` in theory
- In practice, cache refresh is unreliable on Supabase free tier
- Supabase team aware of issue but no ETA on fix
- Affects both anon and service_role API keys

---

### Lesson 2: API Key Confusion (sb_secret vs JWT)

#### Problem
Discord bot and worker used `sb_secret_XXXXX...` format key, but heartbeat kept getting "Invalid API key" errors.

#### Root Cause
**Misunderstanding of Supabase key formats:**
- `sb_secret_...` is NOT a valid Supabase API key format
- Valid keys are JWT format: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...`
- The `sb_secret_...` key happened to work for some operations but not others

#### Impact
- Wasted 1+ hour debugging "why same key works in one file but not another"
- Multiple process restarts
- Confusion about which key to use

#### Solution
**Use the correct service_role key from Supabase dashboard:**
```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...<REDACTED - get from Supabase dashboard>
```

#### Prevention Guidelines
1. **Always use JWT-format keys** from Supabase dashboard → Settings → API
2. **Two types of keys:**
   - `anon` key: For client-side, respects RLS policies
   - `service_role` key: For server-side, bypasses RLS
3. **Never use keys that start with `sb_secret_`** - these are internal/deprecated
4. **Verify key format** before using: should start with `eyJ`
5. **Store keys in environment variables** (not hardcoded) for production

### Lesson 3: Discord Bot Message Spamming

#### Problem
Discord bot posted the same completed task 3+ times to #updates channel, causing spam.

#### Root Cause
**Missing `announced` column in database schema:**
- Worker marked task as `completed` multiple times (bug in worker loop)
- Discord bot polled for `status = 'completed'` tasks
- No flag to track "already posted to Discord"
- Same task posted repeatedly

#### Impact
- Cluttered #updates channel
- Confused founder ("why is Edward repeating himself?")
- Wasted Discord API calls

#### Solution
**Add `announced` boolean column to `ops_mission_steps`:**

```sql
ALTER TABLE ops_mission_steps 
ADD COLUMN announced BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
```

**Update Discord bot logic:**
```javascript
// Poll for completions
const { data: steps } = await supabase
  .from("ops_mission_steps")
  .select("*")
  .eq("status", "completed")
  .eq("announced", false);  // ✅ Only unannounced

// Post to Discord
for (const step of steps) {
  channel.send(`Task completed: ${step.result}`);
  
  // Mark as announced
  await supabase
    .from("ops_mission_steps")
    .update({ announced: true })
    .eq("id", step.id);
}
```

#### Prevention Guidelines
1. **Always include idempotency flags** for external actions (Discord posts, emails, API calls)
2. **Use database transactions** to ensure flag is set atomically with action
3. **Test polling loops** with duplicate data to catch spam issues early
4. **Add rate limiting** as backup (e.g., max 1 post per task per minute)

---

### Lesson 4: Context Loss Between Sessions

#### Problem
After session reset, detailed artifacts (agent role cards, design decisions, code iterations) were lost from context.

#### Root Cause
**Context compression for token limits:**
- Manus compresses conversation history to fit token limits
- High-level progress preserved, but detailed artifacts removed
- Files and images not accessible after compression

#### Impact
- Had to recreate agent role cards from founder's uploaded file
- Lost track of original agent names (Edward, Faye, Spike, etc.)
- Deployed agents with generic names instead of proper names
- Founder frustrated by apparent "memory loss"

#### Solution
**Save critical artifacts to persistent files:**
1. Agent role cards → `/root/team_role_cards.md` on VPS
2. Feature backlog → `/root/feature_backlog.md`
3. Technical decisions → `/root/decisions.md`
4. Database schema → `/root/schema.sql`

**Use Google Drive for founder access:**
- Upload key documents to founder's Google Drive
- Provide shareable links in Discord
- Ensures founder has copies even if context lost

#### Prevention Guidelines
1. **Save artifacts to files immediately** after creation (don't rely on context)
2. **Use descriptive filenames** (e.g., `agent_role_cards_v2.md` not `notes.txt`)
3. **Store files in multiple locations:**
   - VPS: `/root/project_name/`
   - Google Drive: Shared folder
   - GitHub: Private repo (future)
4. **Create a "project index" file** listing all important artifacts and their locations
5. **At end of each session, create a summary document** with links to all artifacts

---

### Lesson 5: Non-Technical Founder Workflow

#### Problem
Founder is non-technical but needs to run commands on VPS. Initial instructions were too complex or assumed knowledge.

#### Root Cause
**Mismatch between founder skill level and instruction detail:**
- Commands like `sed -i 's/pattern/replace/g'` failed due to regex complexity
- Founder didn't know how to find specific lines in files with nano
- Assumed familiarity with concepts like "schema cache" and "JWT"

#### Impact
- Founder frustration ("stop wasting my time")
- Multiple failed attempts at same fix
- Slower progress than expected

#### Solution
**Adjust instruction style:**
1. **Provide complete file rewrites** instead of "edit line 42"
2. **Use `cat > file.js << 'EOF'` pattern** for full file replacement
3. **Explain WHY** not just WHAT (e.g., "schema cache bug means we can't use this column")
4. **One command at a time** with expected output
5. **Ask for confirmation** before complex operations

#### Prevention Guidelines
1. **Assume zero technical knowledge** unless proven otherwise
2. **Provide complete, copy-paste-ready commands** (no placeholders like `<YOUR_KEY>`)
3. **Show expected output** so founder knows if it worked
4. **Explain errors in plain English** (not just stack traces)
5. **Create scripts for complex operations** (e.g., `deploy_agents.js` instead of multi-step SQL)
6. **Use visual confirmations** (e.g., "You should see 3 processes with 'online' status")
